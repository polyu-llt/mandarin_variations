These results were produced by using the HeLI with language model adaptation technique, similar to the one we used with the HeLI method in GDI 2018 (Jauhiainen-Jauhiainen-Lind√©n 2018: HeLI-based Experiments in Swiss German Dialect Identification), but we added also a separate confidence threshold. We added the information from the line only if the confidence of the identification was higher than 0.42. We used whole words and character n-grams from 1 to 2.

As a smoothing value in case a feature was not found in a language, we used the negative logarithm of an n-gram appearing only once multiplied by a penalty modifier. In this case, the penalty modifier was 1.12. This is the same implementation which we used as the best CLI baseline (https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01891).

The n-gram models used, penalty modifier, and the confidence value used in adaptation were optimized using the development data.

As training data for this run, we used the combination of the train.txt and the dev.txt files provided.
