These results were produced by using the HeLI with language model adaptation technique, similar to the one we used with the HeLI method in GDI 2018 (Jauhiainen-Jauhiainen-Lind√©n 2018: HeLI-based Experiments in Swiss German Dialect Identification). We used whole words and character n-grams from 1 to 2.

As a smoothing value in case a feature was not found in a language, we used the negative logarithm of an n-gram appearing only once multiplied by a penalty modifier. In this case, the penalty modifier was 1.01.

The n-gram models used, penalty modifier, and the confidence value used in adaptation were optimized using the development data.

As training data for this run, we used the combination of the train.txt and the dev.txt files provided.
