This system is a 2-layer compositional recurrent neural network that learns numerical representations of sentences based on their words, and of words based on their characters. The system receives as input the text from the instance being classified only, with no additional features or resources. The model was trained exclusively on the training data provided by the organizers, and was validated on the dev set provided. The model was implemented in Pytorch.
